        <p class="text-center">This website uses data available from the
            <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a>.  As such,
            only data for publicly viewable repositories can be collected.</p>

        <p class="text-center">Determination of a user's location is done using
            the free-form data that user's are able to enter into their GitHub
            profile.  For example, if the search is on "Victoria BC, Canada" but
            the user doesn't include the word Victoria in their location (using
            for instance Saanich which is part of Victoria) then that user will
            not be recognized.</p>
